(ns kotoba.dtn.store
  "A durable (disk-backed) log format for a DTN node's :store — the
  bundles it is holding but has not yet delivered (RFC 9171
  store-and-carry custody). Closes a real resilience gap:
  `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp`'s node handle previously kept `:store` in an
  in-memory atom only, so a process crash or restart silently lost every
  undelivered bundle — directly contradicting this library's own
  disaster/carrier-outage resilience purpose.

  FORMAT — newline-delimited `pr-str`'d EDN, one bundle per line (an
  append-only log, same shape as this workspace's other append-only
  ledgers): human-diffable, and a partially-written last line from a
  crash mid-append can never corrupt earlier, already-flushed lines.

  This namespace splits pure logic from Node I/O so the format and
  compaction logic stay testable under plain JVM `clojure -M:test`, same
  as every other namespace in this library except
  `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp` itself:

    serialize-bundle / deserialize-line / compact   -- pure, .cljc, both
                                                        platforms
    load-store / append-bundle! / rewrite-store!    -- Node-only I/O,
                                                        #?(:cljs ...),
                                                        node:fs core
                                                        module, no npm
                                                        dependency

  NOT crash-atomic. `append-bundle!` uses `fs.appendFileSync`, which is
  safe against corrupting prior lines (an interrupted append can only
  leave a truncated LAST line, and `deserialize-line` tolerates that by
  returning nil rather than throwing). `rewrite-store!` uses
  `fs.writeFileSync`, which truncates-then-writes the whole file: a crash
  during that specific call can leave the file empty or partially
  written, losing bundles that were already durably appended earlier in
  the SAME rewrite pass (though never bundles from a completed prior
  append/rewrite). This is a real, disclosed limitation, not a full
  write-ahead-log with fsync+rename durability guarantees — see the
  README's Internet-overlay transport section for the same caveat in
  context.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM for the
  pure half; the I/O half is Node-only (mirrors
  kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's own .cljs-only-behind-a-reader-conditional
  split)."
