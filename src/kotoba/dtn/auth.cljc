(ns kotoba.dtn.auth
  "Origin authentication + tamper-evidence for a DTN bundle, via a
  pre-shared symmetric secret per peer and HMAC-SHA256 — NOT full BPSec
  (RFC 9172) security blocks, NOT a PKI/certificate-issuance system, NOT
  TLS. Closes a real gap in `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp`: that transport
  previously accepted any bundle from any TCP client with zero
  authentication, so any client could connect and inject a bundle
  claiming to be from an arbitrary :dtn/source E.164.

  MECHANISM. Each pair of peers that wants integrity/origin-checking
  shares one secret string out of band (this namespace does not
  distribute or negotiate secrets — see kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's
  :peer-secrets option, a plain {e164 secret} map the operator
  configures). sign-bundle computes HMAC-SHA256 over the bundle's
  canonical `pr-str` representation — with the :dtn/signature field
  itself stripped out FIRST (dissoc'd), so the signature is never
  computed over a self-referential structure that includes itself — and
  assocs the resulting hex digest back in as :dtn/signature. verify-bundle
  strips :dtn/signature the same way, recomputes, and compares.

  This is an HONEST SUBSET, same 'claim exactly what you built'
  discipline as kotoba.dtn.router's direct-neighbor-or-store heuristic
  (not full CGR) and kotoba.dtn's primary-block fields (not a CBOR
  codec). Explicitly, this mechanism:

    DOES:     - detect a bundle whose body was altered in transit or by
                an intermediary after signing (tamper-evidence)
              - reject a bundle claiming a :dtn/source this node has no
                shared secret for, or one signed with the wrong secret
                (origin authentication within the small pre-configured
                peer set)

    DOES NOT: - provide a PKI or certificate-issuance/revocation system
                (deferred, same as this repo's original BPSec deferral —
                a shared-secret scheme doesn't need one, but also can't
                scale past a small pre-configured peer set the way a PKI
                would)
              - provide TLS / transport-layer confidentiality (bundle
                bodies still travel in cleartext over the TCP transport;
                this only lets the receiver detect forgery/tampering, it
                does not hide the payload from an eavesdropper)
              - provide forward secrecy (a single leaked shared secret
                compromises every past and future bundle signed with it
                until the operator rotates it)
              - protect a peer relationship whose secret has actually
                leaked (a holder of the secret can forge bundles
                indistinguishable from genuine ones — this is
                origin-authentication-within-trust-boundary, not a
                defense against a compromised peer)

  An honest tamper-evidence/origin-check for a small, pre-configured peer
  set — not a general Internet-security solution.

  REPLAY PROTECTION (added on top of the above). `kotoba.dtn/bundle`
  already has a `:dtn/sequence-number` field (defaults to 0, previously
  never actually incremented by any caller). Because `sign-bundle` signs
  the ENTIRE bundle map, `:dtn/sequence-number` is already covered by the
  signature once a peer secret is configured — an attacker without the
  shared secret cannot forge a higher sequence number, and a captured,
  validly-signed bundle can be detected as a replay if the receiver
  tracks the highest sequence number it has already accepted from that
  exact source and rejects anything at or below it. `replay?` and
  `update-high-water-mark` below are that check, as pure functions;
  `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp` is the impure caller that wires them into
  the inbound bundle handler (stamping fresh outbound sequence numbers in
  `send-message!`, checking + updating a per-source high-water mark in
  `handle-inbound-bundle!`), and `load-high-water-marks!`/
  `save-high-water-marks!` further below persist that high-water-mark
  state to disk (mirroring `kotoba.dtn.store`'s durability pattern) so it
  survives a node restart when `:replay-state-path` is configured.

  **Replay protection is a property of AUTHENTICATED peers ONLY — it
  only applies when a `:peer-secrets` entry is configured for that
  source.** Without a real signature backing it, a claimed sequence
  number proves nothing: an unauthenticated attacker could just as
  easily forge a high one. This is NOT a general replay-protection
  mechanism for the transport as a whole — see
  `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp`'s docstring for exactly where the
  authenticated-vs-unauthenticated line is drawn.

  CRYPTO IMPLEMENTATION. The bundle-shape/canonicalization logic
  (sign-bundle, verify-bundle, canonical-string below) is pure .cljc and
  identical on both platforms. The actual HMAC-SHA256 computation is
  platform-specific — #?(:clj ...) uses javax.crypto.Mac (JDK standard
  library, no external Maven dependency, which is what makes this whole
  namespace, including sign/verify, testable under plain `clojure
  -M:test`), #?(:cljs ...) uses Node's core node:crypto module (no npm
  dependency, matching kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's existing node:net/node:fs
  convention). Both platforms are exercised for real in this repo: the
  JVM path by test/kotoba/dtn/auth_test.cljc, the Node path by
  kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp wiring bundles signed and verified live over a
  real TCP socket (test/kotoba/dtn/transport/tcp_demo.cljs scenario 4b).
  Sign and verify always run on the SAME runtime for a given
  send/receive pair in this repo's actual usage (kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp
  is Node/.cljs-only), so cross-platform pr-str byte-for-byte parity
  between JVM Clojure and ClojureScript is not required for correctness
  here — only that pr-str is deterministic for a given map value WITHIN
  one runtime process, which it is.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."
