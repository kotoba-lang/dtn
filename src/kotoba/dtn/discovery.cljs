(ns kotoba.dtn.discovery
  "Gossip-based presence broadcast/discovery for kotoba-lang/dtn nodes,
  built directly on kotoba-lang/io-libp2p's real gossip transport
  (kotoba.net.transport.tcp). This is a REAL, DIRECT dependency on
  kotoba-lang/io-libp2p — unlike this repo's deliberately duck-typed,
  dependency-free relationship to kotoba-lang/rcs (see kotoba.dtn.gateway's
  docstring), io-libp2p already exists, is independently stable and
  versioned, and there is no build-order reason to avoid depending on it
  directly here.

  THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Every version of kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's own
  docstring/README has named the same limitation: 'a peer's host:port must
  already be known (passed to start-node! as :peers) ... No discovery, no
  NAT traversal, no gossip routing.' This namespace closes the discovery
  half of that: a dtn node ANNOUNCES its own reachability
  (announce!/start-announcing!) over an io-libp2p gossip node it's also
  running, and every listening dtn node CONSUMES those announcements
  (process-presence-updates!/start-discovering!) to populate its OWN
  :peers map dynamically — a live mutation of a RUNNING node handle's
  :peers, not a restart-time configuration step. Two dtn nodes that were
  never told about each other's host:port in advance can still exchange a
  real bundle over kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp, purely because gossip-based
  discovery told them how to reach each other. See
  test/kotoba/dtn/discovery_demo.cljs for the end-to-end proof (three real
  dtn nodes, three real gossip nodes, zero static :peers config).

  EXPLICITLY NOT:

    - A DHT. There is no distributed routing table, no key-based lookup,
      no notion of 'closest node to a key' — just a flat gossip broadcast
      of 'here is how to reach me' on a well-known topic
      (presence/default-topic, \"dtn-presence\"), consumed by every dtn
      node polling that same topic on the same gossip mesh.
    - Authenticated. A presence announcement is trusted at face value —
      this namespace does not sign, verify, or even sanity-check that the
      gossip :from peer-id has any real relationship to the announced
      :dtn/e164; see kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/valid-presence-announcement?
      for the (structural-only) validation that IS done. Combining a
      newly-discovered peer with kotoba.dtn.auth's :peer-secrets for the
      ACTUAL bundle traffic once it's discovered — so a forged discovery
      announcement can, at worst, get itself added as an unauthenticated
      :peers entry (which kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp already treats exactly
      like any other unauthenticated peer: bundles TO it are sent
      unsigned, bundles CLAIMING to be FROM it are accepted unsigned only
      if this node has no :peer-secrets entry for that e164 either) — is
      the CALLER's job. This module never configures :peer-secrets on
      anyone's behalf.
    - Push/callback-based. kotoba-lang/io-libp2p's transport currently
      exposes no inbound-message callback/hook for a consumer outside its
      own namespace — its only observable integration surface for 'what
      has this gossip node received so far' is the plain
      :received-messages vector living on its own node handle atom (see
      kotoba.net.transport.tcp's handle-gossip! docstring: appended to,
      in order, only on a FRESH — non-duplicate — delivery). Modifying
      io-libp2p to add a push hook was explicitly out of scope for this
      work (io-libp2p is treated here as a stable, already-built
      dependency to consume, not to extend) — this namespace instead
      POLLS that vector on a plain js/setInterval, the same mechanism
      start-announcing! already uses for its own periodic broadcast. A
      deliberate simplicity choice given io-libp2p's current
      observable-state-only integration surface, not an oversight, and
      exactly why io-libp2p itself never needed to change for this to
      work.

  .cljs, NOT .cljc: depends on kotoba.net.transport.tcp (itself Node-only
  .cljs, real socket I/O) and on js/setInterval/js/clearInterval/js/Date.now.
  Never loaded by the JVM `clojure -M:test` suite, so it cannot regress
  this repo's existing pure `.cljc` assertion count — see this repo's
  README for the current count. Only runs under a Node-hosted
  ClojureScript runtime (nbb in this repo), same as
  kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp and kotoba.net.transport.tcp themselves.

  PURE HELPERS live in kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence (portable .cljc,
  covered by clojure -M:test) — announcement shape construction/
  validation, self-announcement detection, translating an announcement
  into the {:host .. :port ..} shape kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's own
  :peers already expects, and the :received-messages dedup-index math.
  This namespace is the impure wiring on top: reading/writing real node
  handle atoms, calling io-libp2p's real publish!, and driving the two
  periodic loops via real JS timers."

  The announcement is built from dtn-node-handle-atom's own :e164/:port
  plus advertise-host (default \"localhost\" — the host OTHER dtn nodes
  should use to reach THIS one; this module has no way to auto-detect a
  node's own externally-reachable address, so pass :advertise-host
  explicitly for anything beyond same-host demo/test use, exactly the same
  caveat kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's own :peers config already has — a
  peer's host has always been caller-supplied, this module only automates
  telling OTHER nodes what that host is). announce-ts is stamped from
  js/Date.now() right here — see kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence's namespace
  docstring for why a varying value per call matters (gossip content-hash
  dedup would otherwise silently suppress every re-announcement after the
  first).

  Returns whatever kotoba.net.transport.tcp/publish! returns: the fanout
  vector of {:to peer-id :payload payload} entries actually written to
  just now (empty if this gossip node currently has no peers subscribed
  to topic)."

  interval-ms defaults to 1500 — reasonable for this repo's own demo/test

  much slower (tens of seconds to minutes is typical for a
  gossip-presence system in the wild) to keep steady-state gossip traffic
  light; this default is deliberately fast only so a test/demo doesn't
  have to wait long for a discovery cycle to land.

(defn process-presence-updates!
  "Scan gossip-node-handle-atom's :received-messages (READ-ONLY — this
  namespace never mutates io-libp2p's own node handle, treating it purely
  as an external observable data source, per this namespace's docstring)
  for presence announcements on topic that dtn-node-handle-atom hasn't
  already processed, and merge each genuinely new, structurally-valid,
  NON-SELF one into dtn-node-handle-atom's OWN :peers map.

  Dedup bookkeeping (:discovery/processed-count — how many raw
  :received-messages entries have already been looked at) is tracked on
  DTN-NODE-HANDLE-ATOM itself, not on the gossip node handle: this dtn
  node is the one doing the scanning/consuming, and tracking the
  high-water mark on its own handle means a single gossip node could, in
  principle, be polled by more than one independent scanner (this
  function, or a future different consumer) without their progress
  colliding — kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/new-entries is the pure
  function that actually does this index math (see its docstring).

  For each new entry whose :topic matches AND whose :payload passes
  kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/valid-presence-announcement? AND is NOT a
  self-announcement (kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/self-announcement?,
  compared against this dtn node's own :e164 — a node must never add
  itself as its own discovered peer): dtn-node-handle-atom's :peers is
  updated (assoc, keyed by the announced :dtn/e164) with
  kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/announcement->peer-entry's
  {:host .. :port ..} — exactly the shape kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp's
  start-node! :peers option and links-for already consume, so this is a
  LIVE update to a RUNNING node's peer table (the very next
  route-and-send!/links-for call on this node handle sees it), not
  something that requires a restart. A structurally-invalid payload (see
  valid-presence-announcement?) is silently skipped — this module's trust
  posture (see namespace docstring) is 'usable at face value once its
  shape is usable', not 'log and reject a malformed one loudly' (a
  malformed presence broadcast is not a security event the way a failed
  bundle-signature check is over in kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp — it's just
  not usable).

  Returns the vector of e164s actually added/updated into :peers this
