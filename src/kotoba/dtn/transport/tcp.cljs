(ns kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp
  "A real, working transport for the internet-overlay link kind that
  kotoba.dtn.link already models — plain TCP. This is the first namespace
  in kotoba-dtn that actually moves bytes between OS processes; everything
  else in this library (kotoba.dtn, kotoba.dtn.link, kotoba.dtn.router,
  kotoba.dtn.gateway) is deliberately pure/I/O-free data-model code, and
  stays that way — this namespace is a consumer of those namespaces, not
  a replacement for their purity.

  .cljs, NOT .cljc: it requires real socket I/O, so it only runs under a
  Node.js-hosted ClojureScript runtime (nbb in this repo). The JVM
  `clojure -M:test` suite does not — and cannot — load `.cljs` files, so
  this namespace can never regress the existing pure `.cljc` test suite
  (see this repo's README for the current assertion count).

  SCOPE — direct internet-overlay transport only: a peer's IP:host and
  port must already be known (passed in via `:peers` to `start-node!`).
  There is no peer discovery, no NAT traversal, and no gossip/relay
  routing here. Real multi-hop composition — discovering peers and
  routing around NATs via `kotoba-lang/net` (gossip) and
  `kotoba-lang/turn` (relay) — remains explicitly future work, same as
  the deferral this namespace closes only the 'does any transport
  actually move bytes' gap, not the 'production-grade P2P overlay' gap.

  Mesh-radio and satellite `:dtn/transport-kind`s are NOT implemented
  here — no such hardware exists in this dev environment to drive. Only
  `:internet-overlay` gets a real transport in this namespace;
  `kotoba.dtn.router/route-decision` itself stays transport-agnostic and
  will happily rank a (caller-supplied) mesh-radio or satellite link
  too, this namespace just doesn't provide one.

  WIRE FRAMING / SOCKET PLUMBING — delegated to `kotoba.wire`
  (https://github.com/kotoba-lang/wire, Phase 2 of a shared-lib
  consolidation across kotoba-lang protocol libraries; Phase 1 was
  `kotoba-lang/bytes`, which `kotoba-lang/wire` itself depends on). This
  namespace used to hand-roll its own 4-byte-big-endian-length-prefix
  framing directly on Node `Buffer`s, its own per-connection
  buffer-accumulation/defragmentation logic, and its own ad-hoc outbound
  socket pool (a `:sockets` map, lazy connect-or-reuse) — none of that
  plumbing was actually DTN-specific. It now calls
  `kotoba.wire.tcp/start-server!` / `connect-or-reuse!` / `send-framed!`
  / `close-all!` for exactly that mechanics, and `kotoba.wire.edn/encode`
  for the one place (`encode-frame`, below) this namespace still needs a
  raw framed byte payload directly rather than going through a socket.
  The wire FORMAT itself is unchanged (same 4-byte BE length prefix +
  UTF-8 `pr-str`'d EDN payload this namespace always used — see
  `kotoba-lang/wire`'s README for the format spec) — this refactor moved
  WHERE the mechanics live, not what actually goes on the wire, so it is
  provably wire-compatible with every bundle this namespace has ever sent
  or received. Every DTN-specific behavior (store-and-forward, relay,
  auth, replay checking — everything below this point) is untouched.

  Four optional `start-node!` options close real gaps in this transport:
  `:store-path` (see `kotoba.dtn.store`) makes the node's undelivered
  `:store` survive a process crash/restart instead of being purely
  in-memory, `:peer-secrets` (see `kotoba.dtn.auth`) adds pre-shared
  HMAC-SHA256 signing/verification so a receiving node can detect a
  forged or tampered bundle instead of accepting anything any TCP client
  sends, `:routes` (see `kotoba.dtn.router`'s :relay action) lets a
  node forward a bundle through a configured intermediate peer when it
  has no direct link to the bundle's final destination — STATIC,
  pre-configured relay only, no automatic route discovery/advertisement
  — and `:replay-state-path` (see `kotoba.dtn.auth`'s replay-protection
  functions, below) persists the per-source sequence-number high-water
  marks that back replay protection so they survive a restart too. All
  four are opt-in and backward compatible: omitted, this namespace
  behaves exactly as it did before any of them existed.

  REPLAY PROTECTION. Every locally-originated `send-message!` call stamps
  a fresh, strictly-increasing `:dtn/sequence-number` onto the outbound
  bundle BEFORE signing (so the signature — which covers the whole
  bundle map — covers the sequence number too, once `:peer-secrets` is
  configured for that peer). On the receiving side, once a bundle has
  passed HMAC verification for a peer this node has a configured secret
  for, `handle-inbound-bundle!` additionally checks whether its
  `:dtn/sequence-number` is strictly greater than the highest one
  already accepted from that exact source (`kotoba.dtn.auth/replay?`
  against a per-source high-water mark kept on the node handle as
  `:replay-high-water-marks`); if not — an exact resend of an old,
  legitimately-signed bundle, or an older one arriving out of order —
  the bundle is REJECTED and logged distinctly (`DTN-REPLAY-REJECTED`),
  the same 'security event, not a delivery to retry later' treatment the
  existing signature-rejection path already gets: never added to
  `:inbox`, never stored, never relayed onward. **This only applies to
  authenticated peers** — a source with no `:peer-secrets` entry
  configured has no replay protection at all (a claimed sequence number
  from an unauthenticated sender proves nothing an attacker couldn't
  also forge), exactly as `kotoba.dtn.auth`'s docstring specifies.
  Relaying an inbound bundle onward (the destination-mismatch path,
  below) does NOT touch the original bundle's `:dtn/sequence-number` —
  only `send-message!`, for this node's own locally-originated sends,
  stamps a fresh one; a relay node is not the bundle's source.

  `:replay-high-water-marks` is seeded at `start-node!` time from
  `kotoba.dtn.auth/load-high-water-marks` when `:replay-state-path` is
  configured (mirrors `:store-path`'s seeding of `:store` from
  `kotoba.dtn.store/load-store`), and durably
  `kotoba.dtn.auth/save-high-water-marks!`'d to that same path every time
  a new high-water mark is actually accepted. **When `:replay-state-path`
  is omitted, the high-water-mark map is in-memory only — a node restart
  resets it, meaning an attacker who captured an old, legitimately-signed
  bundle before that restart could successfully replay it right after
  the restart.** This is a disclosed limitation of the unconfigured case,
  not a silent gap: combine replay protection with `:replay-state-path`
  (ideally alongside `:store-path`, so both durable-state files persist
  together) whenever a node needs its replay protection to actually
  survive a restart; a node that only cares about in-process replay
  protection (e.g. this repo's own demo/CLI runs) can leave it
  unconfigured, consistent with that node's own already-volatile
  in-memory `:store`/`:inbox`.

  Relaying also closes a related correctness gap: previously, any
  successfully-decoded (and, when configured, signature-verified) inbound
  bundle was accepted straight into this node's own `:inbox` regardless
  of whether its `:dtn/destination` actually matched this node's own EID
  — harmless while every message happened to be sent directly to its
  intended recipient, but wrong once relaying exists. `handle-inbound-bundle!`
  now checks that match: a bundle addressed to someone else is never
  added to `:inbox` here — it's re-routed via the same `route-and-send!`
  this node uses for its own locally-originated sends (see below)."

(defn- handle-inbound-bundle!

  when no :peer-secrets entry is configured for the claimed sender): an
  unverifiable/failed-verification bundle is logged and DROPPED outright
  — never added to :inbox, and never added to :store/retried (it isn't a
  legitimate delivery to retry-later, it's a security event).

  Next, ONLY for a bundle whose source IS authenticated (a :peer-secrets
  entry is configured for it — see peer-secret), checks replay
  protection (kotoba.dtn.auth/replay?, against this node's
  :replay-high-water-marks entry for that source): a bundle whose
  :dtn/sequence-number is not strictly greater than the highest one
  already accepted from that exact source is a replay (an exact resend)
  or reordering (an older bundle arriving late) and gets the identical
  DROPPED-outright treatment as a failed-verification bundle, logged
  distinctly as DTN-REPLAY-REJECTED. A source with no :peer-secrets entry
  at all skips this check entirely — replay protection is a property of
  authenticated peers only (see kotoba.dtn.auth's docstring for why an
  unauthenticated claimed sequence number can't be trusted). When a
  bundle passes this check (or the check doesn't apply), and it came from
  an authenticated source, :replay-high-water-marks is advanced right
  here — before the expired?/mismatch? branches below run — so a
  bundle's sequence number is 'spent' (can never be replayed again) the
  moment it's accepted as fresh, regardless of what happens to it next
  (dropped for being expired, relayed onward, or added to :inbox). When
  :replay-state-path is configured, that advance is also durably
  kotoba.dtn.auth/save-high-water-marks!'d to disk in the same step.

  Otherwise drops expired bundles (RFC 9171 retention constraint
  elapsed).

  Otherwise checks whether bundle's :dtn/destination actually matches
  this node's own EID:

  - MATCH (this bundle really is addressed to this node): the original
    behavior — tries to shape the payload as an RCS-shaped or SMS-shaped
    message (kotoba.dtn.gateway) purely for demo/operator visibility, and
    appends {:message <decoded-or-nil> :bundle bundle} onto the node's
    :inbox so an operator (or this repo's E2E demo) can observe what
    actually arrived. Logs DTN-RECV.

  - MISMATCH (this node is only an intermediate relay hop for this
    bundle): the bundle is NEVER added to :inbox — it isn't this node's
    message. Its :dtn/hop-count is incremented (missing/nil treated as
    0) and it's handed to route-and-send! again — the SAME function this
    node uses for its own locally-originated sends — using this node's
    OWN :peers-derived links and configured :routes, so it either
    forwards/relays onward for real or falls back to this node's own
    :store if it, too, has no path to the destination right now. Logs
    DTN-RELAY (distinct from DTN-RECV) including a preview of the routing
    decision (`via`) computed from the exact same pure
    kotoba.dtn.router/route-decision call route-and-send! is about to
    make — not a fabricated/out-of-band log line.

    A lightweight, node-local :seen-bundle-ids set (NOT full DTN
    routing-loop detection, no cross-node coordination — see
    kotoba.dtn.router's docstring for the honest scope of the hop-count
    guard this complements) suppresses re-relaying the exact same
    :dtn/bundle-id twice through this node, so a bundle that somehow
    loops back to a node it already passed through doesn't get
    re-forwarded a second time by that node."

  node restarted after a crash picks up exactly where it left off:
  Resilience for real, not just while the process happens to keep
  running), and every bundle that later falls back into :store
  (route-and-send!'s failed-forward path, or a bundle handed straight to
  :store because no link was reachable) is also durably append-bundle!'d
  to this same path. When omitted, :store stays purely in-memory —
  IDENTICAL to this option not existing at all, so every existing caller
  (the CLI, the E2E demo's scenarios 1-3) is unaffected.

  :peer-secrets (optional, see kotoba.dtn.auth) — a {e164 secret-string}
  map of pre-shared HMAC secrets, one per peer this node wants
  origin-authenticated / tamper-evident bundle exchange with. When a
  secret is configured for a given peer: outbound bundles to that peer
  are kotoba.dtn.auth/sign-bundle'd before sending, and inbound bundles
  CLAIMING that peer as :dtn/source are verify-bundle'd before being
  accepted into :inbox (a missing/invalid signature is logged and
  dropped — see handle-inbound-bundle!). When no secret is configured
  for a given peer (the common case, and the ONLY case for every
  existing caller), send/receive for that peer is identical to before
  this option existed — no auth is performed, nothing is required or
  rejected.

  :routes (optional, see kotoba.dtn.router's :relay action) — a coll of
  {:dtn/destination eid :dtn/next-hop eid} entries: 'to reach
  :dtn/destination, forward to :dtn/next-hop instead'. Consulted by
  route-and-send! (both for this node's own locally-originated sends and
  when this node relays an inbound bundle addressed to someone else —
  see handle-inbound-bundle!) ONLY when there's no direct link to the
  bundle's destination. STATIC and pre-configured: this node never
  learns, advertises, or gossips routes on its own — the caller supplies
  the table. When omitted (the common case, and the ONLY case for every
  existing caller before this option existed), behavior is unchanged:
  no route table to consult, so a bundle with no direct link always
  falls to :store, exactly as before.

  :replay-state-path (optional, see kotoba.dtn.auth's replay-protection
  functions and this namespace's REPLAY PROTECTION docstring section
  above) — when given, :replay-high-water-marks is seeded at startup
  from kotoba.dtn.auth/load-high-water-marks'ing this path (so a node
  restarted after a crash keeps rejecting replays of everything it had
  already accepted before the restart), and every time a new high-water
  mark is accepted from an authenticated peer it's durably
  kotoba.dtn.auth/save-high-water-marks!'d back to this same path. When
  omitted, :replay-high-water-marks stays purely in-memory — replay
  protection still works for the lifetime of this process, but resets on
  restart (see the REPLAY PROTECTION section above for exactly what that
  does and does not mean)."

  Seeded at start-node! time from js/Date.now() (wall-clock milliseconds,

  than 0: within one process's lifetime this counter is strictly
  increasing by construction (every call increments it, nothing ever

  1970-epoch-old (and therefore immediately :dtn/expired? at any real
