  "Pure, portable (.cljc) helpers for kotoba.dtn.transport.udp's NAT-traversal
  path — constructing the client-side STUN messages a NAT'd dtn node sends to
  a kotoba-lang/org-ietf-turn relay (Allocate, CreatePermission, Send
  indication), parsing STUN responses/indications, and classifying an inbound
  UDP datagram as a relayed Data indication vs. a directly-received raw
  bundle datagram. Zero I/O, zero socket/dgram/Node dependency — every
  function here takes bytes (plus a caller-injected STUN transaction id) in
  and returns a value out, so this is testable under plain JVM
  `clojure -M:test`, same pure/impure split kotoba.turn.stun /
  kotoba.turn.credential / kotoba.turn.allocation already establish in
  org-ietf-turn itself (and the same split kotoba.dtn.auth / kotoba.dtn.store
  already establish in this repo).

  WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE .cljc FILE, NOT INLINE IN
  kotoba.dtn.transport.udp. kotoba.dtn.transport.udp is .cljs-only (real
  node:dgram socket I/O, same split as kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp). The actual
  wire-construction sequence below mirrors org-ietf-turn's own
  test/kotoba/turn/listener_demo.cljs client-side helpers
  (build-allocate-request / build-create-permission-request /
  build-send-indication) almost exactly — this namespace is dtn's own copy
  of that same 'how do I speak TURN client-side' logic (org-ietf-turn's demo
  code is test-only and deliberately not a reusable library surface — see
  its own namespace docstring: 'never by calling into kotoba.turn.listener's
  own internal handler functions... the only honest way to prove the
  LISTENER's own parsing/dispatch/relay logic is real'), adapted here to
  take an externally-supplied STUN transaction id (so this stays
  deterministic/testable) rather than generating one internally with
  `rand-int` — kotoba.dtn.transport.udp is the impure .cljs caller that
  supplies a real random txid and a real dgram socket.

  SCOPED, NOT FULL ICE (see kotoba.dtn.transport.udp's own namespace
  docstring for the complete, honest disclosure of what this whole
  NAT-traversal capability does and does not cover). Specifically in THIS
  namespace: only Allocate + CreatePermission + Send/Data indication are
  modeled — no ChannelBind fast-path construction (a NAT'd dtn node's
  outbound traffic always goes as a full STUN Send indication, a few more
  bytes per message than a bound channel would cost once amortized — a
  disclosed, deliberate scope cut, not an oversight; org-ietf-turn's own
  listener still supports ChannelBind server-side, this namespace's client
  just never uses it), and no Refresh-request construction (no automatic
  re-Allocate before expiry — see kotoba.dtn.transport.udp)."

(defn classify-inbound-datagram

  dtn node's socket handler, as one of:

    :data-indication — kotoba.turn.demux/classify-datagram says :stun AND it
        decodes as a well-formed STUN message of type
        kotoba.turn.stun/data-indication. This is the expected, common case
        for a NAT'd node's ongoing inbound traffic once its Allocate +
        CreatePermission handshake has completed: unwrap via
        data-indication-payload and treat the result exactly like a
        directly-received raw bundle datagram.

    :other-stun — kotoba.turn.demux/classify-datagram says :stun AND it
        decodes as a well-formed STUN message, but NOT a Data indication
        (e.g. a stray Allocate/CreatePermission response arriving after
        this node's startup handshake already consumed the one it was
        waiting for, or a Refresh/ChannelBind response this scoped client
        never sends a request for in the first place). Not expected on this
        path in this repo's actual usage; the caller logs and drops it
        rather than crashing.

    :raw-bundle — either kotoba.turn.demux/classify-datagram already says
        :channel-data or :unknown (this repo's UDP client never sends
        ChannelBind, so a genuine ChannelData datagram arriving here would
        be unexpected too, but is still routed to this branch rather than
        :other-stun — there is no 'other channel-data' case to distinguish
        it from), OR classify-datagram said :stun (its check is only the
        leading-2-bits + minimum-length heuristic from RFC 8489 §5, not a
        full parse) but the datagram then fails to actually decode as a
        well-formed STUN message (bad magic cookie) — the correct reading
        of THAT combination is 'not actually STUN, coincidentally started
        with a 00-leading-bits byte', not 'a corrupt STUN message'. A
        directly-received raw pr-str'd EDN bundle can legitimately land in
        this second sub-case: ClojureScript's *print-namespace-maps*-shorthand
        printing of a bundle's namespaced keys begins with '#' (0x23 —
        binary 00100011, top 2 bits 00), which is exactly the leading-bits
        pattern RFC 8489 §5 reserves for STUN; the magic-cookie check at
        bytes 4-8 is what actually disambiguates the two in practice (an
        astronomically unlikely, not practically occurring, coincidental
        false-negative is theoretically possible here, same as any 32-bit
        checksum/magic-number collision anywhere in this whole protocol
        stack — an honest, disclosed limitation, not a claim of zero
        collision risk). This branch's caller (kotoba.dtn.transport.udp)
        then attempts the ordinary UTF-8-decode + edn/read-string a
        non-relayed node's inbound handler already does, itself tolerant of
        genuinely-malformed input.

  Never throws."
