(ns kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence
  "Pure, transport-independent helpers factored out of `kotoba.dtn.discovery`
  (the `.cljs`, Node-only namespace that actually wires a dtn node handle to
  a real `kotoba-lang/io-libp2p` gossip node handle): presence-announcement
  shape construction/validation, self-announcement detection, translating an
  announcement into the `{:host .. :port ..}` shape `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp`'s
  own `:peers`/`links-for` already expect, and the dedup-index math used to
  scan an ever-growing `:received-messages` vector without reprocessing an
  entry twice.

  None of this needs a real socket, a real clock read, or a real
  `js/setInterval` — every function here is deterministic given its
  arguments — so it stays portable `.cljc` and testable under plain JVM
  `clojure -M:test`, mirroring the pure/impure split
  `kotoba-lang/io-libp2p`'s own `kotoba.net.transport.envelope` uses
  alongside its impure `kotoba.net.transport.tcp`, and the split
  `kotoba.dtn.auth`/`kotoba.dtn.store` already use between their portable
  format logic and their Node-only I/O calls.

  ANNOUNCEMENT SHAPE — a plain EDN map:

    {:dtn/e164 \"+819012345678\"
     :dtn/host \"localhost\"
     :dtn/port 5100
     :dtn/transport-kind :internet-overlay
     :dtn/announce-ts 1234567890}

  `:dtn/host`/`:dtn/port` are exactly the `{:host .. :port ..}` shape a
  `kotoba.dtn.link/link` record's fields need (and exactly the shape
  `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp/start-node!`'s own `:peers` option and
  `links-for` already consume) — see `announcement->peer-entry`, which is
  close to mechanical because of that.

  `:dtn/announce-ts` exists for a real, non-obvious reason discovered while
  wiring this module up against `kotoba-lang/io-libp2p`'s actual gossip
  semantics (`kotoba.net.gossip/route-message`, `content-hash`): a gossip
  node's dedup is purely CONTENT-hash based (`content-hash` hashes the
  payload alone, nothing else — see `kotoba.net.gossip`), and a
  locally-originated `publish!` marks its own payload's hash `seen` on the
  PUBLISHING node's own seen-cache the moment it's first sent (see
  `kotoba.net.transport.tcp/publish!`'s docstring). Two consequences that
  matter for a PERIODIC presence broadcast specifically:

    1. If a node re-announced the exact same `{:dtn/e164 :dtn/host
       :dtn/port :dtn/transport-kind}` map on every tick with no varying
       field, every re-announcement after the very first would hash
       IDENTICALLY to the first — `route-message` would see it as
       already-seen on the announcing node's OWN seen-cache and return an
       EMPTY `:forward` list, meaning `publish!` would silently stop
       actually writing to any peer's socket at all after the first tick.
    2. That would break exactly the scenario this whole module exists to
       prove: a NODE THAT JOINS THE GOSSIP MESH LATE (after the first,
       only-ever-delivered broadcast already happened) would never
       discover an already-running peer, because that peer's later
       re-broadcasts — the only ones with a chance of actually reaching a
       socket that didn't exist yet at broadcast #1 — would all be no-ops.

  Including a monotonically-varying `:dtn/announce-ts` (the impure
  `kotoba.dtn.discovery/announce!` stamps `js/Date.now()` here, the same
  seam `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp/send-message!` already uses to stamp a
  real wall-clock value from the one layer that actually has a clock) makes
  every tick's payload content-hash genuinely distinct, so `route-message`
  never short-circuits a re-announcement as an already-seen duplicate on
  the SENDING side — every periodic tick is a real, fresh fanout attempt,
  which is what lets a late-joining node actually receive a presence
  announcement broadcast strictly after it joined. This is deliberately
  NOT fixed by editing `kotoba.net.gossip` itself (out of scope — a pure
  consumer relationship, see `kotoba.dtn.discovery`'s namespace docstring);
  it's accommodated here, in the shape of the data this module chooses to
  broadcast, exactly the same kind of external workaround
  `kotoba.net.transport.tcp`'s own `safe-from` already is for a different
  `kotoba.net.gossip` landmine."
