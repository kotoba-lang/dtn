;; Not a unit test — an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely
;; pass when run. It proves kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp actually moves bytes
;; between real OS processes over a real socket, and that the
;; store-and-forward resilience property the whole design exists for is
;; real. Run from this repo's root:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:../phone/src:../html/src:../css/src:../wire/src:../bytes/src" \
;;     test/kotoba/dtn/transport/tcp_demo.cljs
;;
;; (relative --classpath entries mean this must run with cwd at this
;; repo's root, with kotoba-lang/phone, /html, /css, /wire, /bytes checked
;; out as siblings — same layout deps.edn already assumes (/wire and
;; /bytes are needed because kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp delegates its wire
;; framing/socket-pool mechanics to kotoba.wire, built on kotoba.bytes,
;; instead of implementing them inline). Scenario 1 also `spawn`s a second
;; real `nbb` process, found via $PATH, running bin/dtn_node.cljs with the
;; same --classpath.)
;;
;; Scenarios 4a/4b (added alongside this repo's durable-store +
;; bundle-integrity hardening) prove the two gaps that used to undercut
;; this library's own stated disaster/carrier-outage resilience purpose
;; are actually closed: 4a proves the on-disk :store-path log survives a
;; real (simulated) process restart, not just that the pure
;; serialize/deserialize functions round-trip in isolation; 4b proves an
;; HMAC-signed peer accepts a legitimately signed bundle and REJECTS a
;; bundle forged with the wrong secret sent directly over a raw socket
;; (bypassing send-message!'s normal signing path entirely).
;;
;; Scenario 5 (added alongside this repo's static multi-hop relay
;; routing) proves an A -> B -> C relay actually happens over real TCP,
;; not just at the pure kotoba.dtn.router/route-decision level: node A
;; has NO direct link/peer entry for node C at all, only a configured
;; :routes entry saying 'reach C via B', and node B has a genuine direct
;; link to C. It confirms the message actually flows A -> B -> C (C's
;; :inbox gets it for real), that B does NOT silently absorb a bundle
;; addressed to someone else into its own :inbox (the destination-mismatch
;; fix), and that B's relay was a real routing decision (not an
;; out-of-band cheat) by capturing B's own DTN-RELAY log line.
;;
;; Scenario 6 (added alongside this repo's per-source sequence-number
;; replay protection) proves a captured, legitimately HMAC-signed bundle
;; cannot be re-sent later and accepted a second time: two nodes exchange
;; one real signed message over TCP, the demo captures the EXACT bundle
;; node B actually decoded off the wire (from B's own :inbox — not a
;; hand-rolled reconstruction), re-sends those exact same signed bytes a
;; second time over a fresh raw socket (bypassing send-message!'s normal
;; fresh-sequence-number stamping entirely), and confirms B's :inbox still
;; has exactly ONE copy of that message (not two) and logged
;; DTN-REPLAY-REJECTED. It then confirms a genuinely NEW message (a fresh
;; sequence number, via a normal send-message! call) is still accepted
;; right after — proving replay rejection doesn't wrongly block
;; legitimate subsequent traffic from the same authenticated source.
;;
;; Prints PASS/FAIL per scenario, a final "RESULT: N/7 scenarios passed"
;; line, and exits 0 iff all 7 passed (else 1).
