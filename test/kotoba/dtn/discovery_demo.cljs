;; Not a unit test — an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely
;; pass when run. It proves kotoba.dtn.discovery actually closes dtn's
;; long-named "no discovery" gap for real: dtn nodes announcing their own
;; reachability over a REAL kotoba-lang/io-libp2p gossip mesh, and every
;; listening dtn node consuming those announcements to populate its OWN
;; :peers map dynamically — culminating in two dtn nodes that were NEVER
;; told about each other's host:port in this test's own setup still
;; exchanging a real bundle over real dtn TCP, purely because gossip-based
;; discovery told them how to reach each other. Run from this repo's root:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:../phone/src:../html/src:../css/src:../wire/src:../bytes/src:../io-libp2p/src" \
;;     test/kotoba/dtn/discovery_demo.cljs
;;
;; (relative --classpath entries mean this must run with cwd at this
;; repo's root, with kotoba-lang/phone, /html, /css, /wire, /bytes, and
;; /io-libp2p checked out as siblings — the new /io-libp2p entry is what
;; this demo needs beyond the existing tcp_demo.cljs classpath, since
;; kotoba.dtn.discovery is a real, direct dependency on
;; kotoba.net.transport.tcp.)
;;
;; All three scenarios run in-process (multiple real dtn node handles AND
;; real gossip node handles, real TCP sockets on both transports, same OS
;; process) — the same pattern most of kotoba-lang/dtn's own
;; tcp_demo.cljs scenarios (2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6) and kotoba-lang/io-libp2p's
;; own tcp_demo.cljs scenarios (2, 3) already use; sufficient here given
;; how many real node handles and periodic timers this demo already
;; coordinates (6+ node handles, up to 8 concurrent js/setInterval loops
;; in scenario 3) without the extra weight of spawning separate OS
;; processes for every scenario the way tcp_demo.cljs's OWN scenario 1
;; does for its strongest-form proof.
;;
;; Scenario 1 is the actual close-the-loop proof this whole phase exists
;; for: three dtn nodes started with :peers {} (genuinely no static
;; config at all) and three io-libp2p gossip nodes wired to them via
;; start-announcing!/start-discovering!. It asserts, BEFORE sending
;; anything, that node A's :peers went from empty (captured the instant
;; after start-node!, before any discovery loop even starts) to actually
;; containing real entries for B AND C, populated purely by gossip
;; discovery — then has A send-message! to C over real dtn TCP using
;; that discovered entry, and confirms delivery actually lands in C's
;; :inbox.
;;
;; Scenario 2 proves self-filtering two ways: first, that a real
;; full-mesh gossip run never puts a node's OWN e164 into its own :peers
;; (true, but a WEAK proof by itself — kotoba.net.gossip's own
;; gossip-fanout already excludes {from self} at the transport layer, so
;; a node's own broadcast never round-trips back to it in a full mesh
;; regardless of whether kotoba.dtn.discovery's OWN self-filtering code
;; does anything at all). Second, and non-vacuously, it directly crafts a
;; syntactically-valid self-announcement for A and injects it into
;; gossip-a's own :received-messages — simulating what a differently
;; shaped topology (a longer relay chain, a ring, a misbehaving peer)
;; could actually deliver — and confirms process-presence-updates! still
;; refuses to add it, proving kotoba.dtn.discovery.presence/self-announcement?
;; is actually wired in and doing real work, not merely untested dead code
;; that happens to never get exercised by this demo's own topology.
;;
;; Scenario 3 proves discovery is symmetric, not just "whichever order
;; happened to be tested": A and B start first, discover each other, and
;; only THEN does C start (a real "late join" — C's own dtn/gossip
;; processes/ports do not exist yet when A and B's mesh config already
;; lists C's address, matching io-libp2p's own static-:peers-at-start-node!
;; scoping — there is no API to add a peer to an already-running gossip
;; node, see its README's Scope section). The demo confirms C eventually
;; discovers BOTH pre-existing A and B, not merely that A/B eventually
;; discover C.
;;
;; Prints PASS/FAIL per scenario, a final "RESULT: N/3 scenarios passed"
;; line, and exits 0 iff all 3 passed (else 1).
